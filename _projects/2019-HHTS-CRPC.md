solicitation-short-description: Conduct a Household Travel Survey (HTS) to get a better understanding on current regional travel patterns and trends in the Capital Region of Louisiana.
---
# Background
The Capital Region Planning Commission (CRPC) is a Council of Governments and is also the designated staff of the Baton Rouge area Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO), serving 5 parishes: East Baton Rouge, West Baton Rouge, Ascension, Livingston and Iberville. As the regional MPO, the Capital Region Planning Commission focuses much of its resources on transportation planning issues and activities, which includes highway and transit planning, the regional ridesharing program, transportation safety, and air quality issues.

CRPC intends to revamp the Capital Region Travel Demand Model prior to initiating the next Metropolitan Transportation Plan update in 2021. This project is envisioned to be completed in two phases. In order to support revamping the regional model, CRPC is in the process of collecting a variety of transportation data sets. These data form a foundation for the regional models’ update, improvement of the regional travel forecast and ultimately better planning decisions. The first will be to conduct a Household Travel Survey (HTS) to get a better handle on current regional travel patterns and characteristics.
Survey Purpose and Goals

Household Travel Survey (HTS) is a necessary part of data collection for transportation planning, travel demand modeling and travel demand forecasting purposes. The purpose of this survey is to capture behavior, patterns and attitudes of the traveling public. This information is later used to estimate travel forecasting models, which are used to analyze and plan regional transportation systems. Recent advances in passive data collection and big data analysis allow substituting some of the data collected through household surveys with alternative data collection and analysis methods. Nevertheless, at the present time, there is no a reliable alternative to household travel surveys to provide the contextual information. HTS continues to be the only source of detailed information on travel behavior and patterns, sufficient for estimation of advanced travel demand models and state- of-the practice travel demand forecasting, system analysis and planning.

At a minimum, the information provided from the survey should support the calculation of: •Trip production rates by trip purpose
 - Trip distribution by time of day
 - Trip length frequency distribution
 - Mode share of travel
 - Travel Time
 - Origins/Destination by geographical zone

Primary goals of this travel survey are to:
 - Understand changing travel behaviors and new, emergent transportation modes (ex. shared mobility)
 - Integrate travel behavior data with 2020 US Decennial Census data
 - Maximize sample size and response rates to develop statistically significant estimates •Build the foundational elements for any future development of activity-based models.

# Project Overview
This survey will cover all potions of CRPC region which are in CRPC regional travel demand forecast model. CRPC regional travel demand model is currently an aggregate, trip-based (“four-step”) travel demand model. The 2019/2020 household travel survey will be the basis to support the development and refinement of CRPC trip-based model, address regional growth and transportation planning issues, as well as support other planning and general research activities.
A Study Oversight Team comprising representatives from CRPC will be assembled to oversee key work elements, review and comment on draft documents, and generally coordinate with the Consultant(s).

# Scope of Services
The Consultant is encouraged to consider best practices for conducting household travels surveys, review data needs of CRPC’s travel demand models and, if needed, suggest changes to the Scope of Services outlined in this section. Although the main portion of this scope of work is a household travel survey, passive data collection (GPS based surveys) should be considered to complete within the available budget.

## Scope of Work
### TASK 1: PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN
All proposals should include a detailed project management plan showing the organization of the study team (including the sub-Consultants – if involved) and the various tasks to perform. It should also include a detailed schedule with milestones, start, and completion dates, key personnel who will supervise the work.

The Consultant will provide quality control/quality assurance (QA/QC) on the products before providing them to CRPC. Consultation and coordination of various tasks and activities will be maintained with the Study Oversight Team. The Consultant shall conduct a kickoff meeting at the CRPC office to discuss the schedule and key elements of the work approach, identify significant issues involved in household travel survey data collection, and discuss methods for reporting work plan progress to CRPC. CRPC will seek input from the Consultant on communication methodologies, outreach to different populations in the region, incentive structure, survey activities, survey schedules, and the content of press releases (if needed). The detailed work plan shall indicate any resources or actions required from CRPC, or other members of the Study Oversight Team.

The time for completion of the project is approximately twelve months after issuance of the notice to proceed (commencement date). During contract negotiation, the commencement date will be confirmed or changed upon mutual consent of CRPC and the Consultant. The surveys are to be conducted in either September, October or November 2019 or February, March, or April 2020. During the period of contract negotiation, all administrative and accounting items will be discussed including: the proposed survey schedule, budget and project monitoring, cost control mechanisms, project status reporting including procedures, problem identification and other project monitoring activities.

The Consultant shall be required to submit to CRPC monthly progress reports, technical memoranda, computer outputs and other forms of data required to support and document the monthly progress reports appropriately. Products to be provided include:
 - Technical memoranda of work performed during the period;
 - An accounting of costs to-date;
 - A statement of project progress and schedule adherence;
 - Notification of any tasks that appear to be in danger of not being completed on schedule.

### TASK 2: SURVEY DESIGN AND DATA COLLECTION PROCEDURE
The Regional Household Travel Survey shall cover the metropolitan planning area and shall provide data required to update CRPC’s four-step travel demand forecast models. Metropolitan planning area includes the entirety of East Baton Rouge and Ascension Parishes and the urbanized portions of West Baton Rouge, Livingston and Iberville Parishes. The purpose of this task is to develop the specifications of the survey instrument and plan details of the survey methodology. It is anticipated that the project will be completed within a twelve-month period, with the survey occurring in September, October, and November 2019 or February, March, and April 2020.

The work to be performed by the Consultant includes a review of the needs of the travel demand models and their data requirements. The survey shall also be designed to collect all the necessary data for subsequent potential development of an activity-based model. The following tasks present some possible sampling strategies, the number of samples required, and the total survey sample size. They explain the need for developing good questionnaires and the importance of conducting a pre-test that properly covers all geographic areas of the region.

*__Note: Consultants are encouraged to expand, propose contemporary and/or innovative methods in completing all tasks.__*
